[PDX Finder](https://www.pdxfinder.org) is the world's largest open [Patient Derived Xenograft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_derived_xenograft) database, containing phenomic information for over 2900 murine models, facilitating data and model sharing for the cancer research community.

Patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models are a critical oncology platform for cancer research, drug development and personalized medicine. However, because of the heterogeneous nature of PDX repositories, finding models of interest is a challenge.

The project aims to integrate, standardize, analyze, and visualize data from labs performing PDX studies.  We are promoting model sharing, standards development (such as [PDX-MI](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29092942/) & PDX-MI2) as well as adoption to ensure global data interoperability.

PDX Finder is deeply embedded in the PDX community, collaborating and providing support to several worldwide consortia including 
[PDXNet](https://www.pdxnetwork.org/), 
[PDMR](https://pdmr.cancer.gov/) and 
[EurOPDX](https://www.europdx.eu/).
